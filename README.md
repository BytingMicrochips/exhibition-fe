# **Artwork & Artifacts Explorer**
## A mobile friendly webpage to discover items from the Art Institute of Chicago and Metropolitan Museum NYC public APIs
### This project is designed to allow the user to enter search terms and search for items from either of the afore mentioned APIs.
Results will then be displayed, with expandable details explaining pertinent information about each of artwork or artifact. The user is also able to view a full screen image of a chosen item, or add it to their own personal collection.
### The users collection of chosen results may be viewed without the current search results being lost. Any items added to the collection may be removed either when they appear as search results, or from the user collection directly.
#### Imagined use case:
*A user is intending to visit the museum or gallery and wanting to plan a list of what to see in person. Considering this, all results display both where they are stored and if they are currently on view to the public. When available, the exacty gallery number of an item's exhibition is also displayed .*
